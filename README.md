This project is to house the files and writeups of different tryhackme.com rooms. This is meant to help me keep a record of what I did or discovered in each room.

I am still very new to the world of infosec, so my write-ups in this repo will also seem very rudimentary and not super in depth as I am learning not only how to do these things but also how to do write-ups. I welcome any feedback so long as it is meant to help me learn and grow!
